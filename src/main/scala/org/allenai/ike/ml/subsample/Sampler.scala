/** Abstract class for classes the subsample data from a corpus using a black lab Searcher.
  * Classes return hits from the corpus that are 'close' to being matched by an input query, where
  * 'close' is defined by the subclass. If a query matches a sentence in multiple ways it is
  * allowed to return the same capture span multiple times (ex. a* cat might return "a a cat" and
  * "a cat" for the sentence "a a cat".
  *
  * The returned hits are additionally expected to be annotated so we can recover which parts of
  * the tokenized query matched which parts of each return hit. This is accomplished by
  * registering capture groups for each query-token in TokenizedQuery that captures which words
  * within each hit that query-token matched. In some cases a query-token might have not matched
  * any tokens within the hit (meaning the query as a whole will not have matched the hit), in
  * this case that query-token's capture group should indicate which part of the hit the
  * query-token would have needed to match for the overall query to match the hit, only with the
  * start and end values negated.
  *
  * Finally, if a query-token is fixed length and will never fail to match some part of the hit,
  * subclasses can choose to not register it in the capture groups. This can make some queries more
  * efficient
